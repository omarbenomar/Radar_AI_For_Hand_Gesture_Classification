# Radar AI for Hand Gesture Classification

## Project Overview
This repository contains machine learning models and data processing pipelines designed to classify hand gestures based on micro-Doppler radar signatures. 

## Features
- Processing and visualization of radar micro-Doppler signature envelopes.
- Implementation of models (e.g., Chebyshev moments) for feature extraction and classification.
- Jupyter Notebooks detailing the experimental setup, data exploration, and model evaluation (`Project ipnyb/`).

## Project Structure
- `Final Project...ipynb` – The main notebook detailing the final implementation and results.
- `pauline_project_ml.ipynb` & Other `.ipynb` files – Various stages of iterations and modeling.

## Getting Started
To view or run the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter and the required Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
```
